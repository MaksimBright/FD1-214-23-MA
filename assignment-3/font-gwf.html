    Adele - Rolling in the deep</h1>
<p style="font-family: Alumni Sans Pinstripe, sans-serif; font-size: 28px">
    There's a fire starting in my heart <br>
    Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark <br>
    Finally, I can see you crystal clear <br>
    Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare <br>
    See how I'll leave with every piece of you <br>
    Don't underestimate the things that I will do <br>
    There's a fire starting in my heart <br>
    Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark <br>
</p>

    Baby, I have no story to be told <br>
    But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn <br>
    Think of me in the depths of your despair <br>
    Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared <br>
